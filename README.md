# Kafka Store Pub/Sub

This Git Repository is a Kafka Producer '-' Consumer model built as 2 distinct Spring MicroServices. This was first developed against Sprint 3.1.5.

There are also Docker-Compose files present to set-up a quick environment to show how the docker configs can quickly configure a kafka lab to test the microsevices.
